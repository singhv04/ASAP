# ASAP
Order and pay from anywhere and get it ready before you reach the shop.It will drastically decrease the crowd and make it convenient for both customer and shop-keeper especially during the peak time.

AUTHENTICATION PROCEDURE:
The authentication used here is OTP along with the unique registration number of the customer(in our case college id).One of the main issue solved is that one student can have more than one contact number so i assured that the student can login only from the contact that is provided in the id.In case of any cahnges he/she may contact the developer.
Email login can be used but there also the customers can have more than one mail id.One alternative is the Aadhar card number but actually that will drastically decrease the customers as they are too lazy to fill complete info of aadhaar card.

Used firebase service to store the real time data and and authentication services.
